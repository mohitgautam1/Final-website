# hello read me and added stylesheet
The website that i created is a portfolio website which includes all of my previous experience,education and other intrest.Which will be responsive for mobile and normal desktop screen size users.

## My designs
My site will be a mobile first responsive site. before i started writing the code, just to get the rough ideas i have drew very basic layout idea for the website.i drew for both mobile size and desktop size.

Eventhough my rough designs arent very neat, there were some changes that i had to make as i went along while coding the site. 

## Three pages that i created

Homepage
Contact me
Resume page-CV included.

## files i created
i started developing the site first using index.html page which then i had to create css stylesheet page to give the style for the pages that i was going to create. i have created two stylesheets, one for homepage and resume and other one for contact us page. the reason i used seperate contact us 'css' file is because if i wanted to change something on the contact us page i could easilt do that so as there wont be much process to look for the code that you are looking for.

i have also created one script.js file which contains all of my javascripts.

## javascript  used
Used google maps Api.
Mobile menu toggle using javascripts and css.

## animations used
there are quite a few animations that i have used on throughout the site. some of them includes such as:
Social icons animation effect on footers.
icons rotaion animation effect.


## encountered problems
One of the problem that i encountered was that i started off my website with max width media querie, where i then had to change majority of my css's. however i did eventually managed to make it min width so it is mobile first.

Second problem that i encountred was that some of the features that i included on the website gets dissapered once i push it to the github pages. however it is completely fine on the original file.
