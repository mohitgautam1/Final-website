# hello read me and added stylesheet
The website that i created is a portfolio website which includes all of my previous experience,education and other intrest.Which will be responsive for mobile and normal desktop screen size users.

## My designs
My site will be a mobile first responsive site. before i started writing the code, just to get the rough ideas i have drew very basic layout idea for the website.i drew for both mobile size and desktop size.

Eventhough my rough designs arent very neat, there were some changes that i had to make as i went along while coding the site. 

## Three pages that i created

Homepage
Contact me
Resume page-CV included.

## files i created
i started developing the site first using index.html page which then i had to create css stylesheet page to give the style for the pages that i was going to create. i have created two stylesheets, one for homepage and resume and other one for contact us page. the reason i used seperate contact us 'css' file is because if i wanted to change something on the contact us page i could easilt do that so as there wont be much process to look for the code that you are looking for.

i have also created one script.js file which contains all of my javascripts.

## javascript  used
Used google maps Api.
Mobile menu toggle using javascripts and css.

## animations used
there are quite a few animations that i have used on throughout the site. some of them includes such as:
Social icons animation effect on footers.
icons rotaion animation effect.


## encountered problems
One of the problem that i encountered was that i started off my website with max width media querie, where i then had to change majority of my css's. however i did eventually managed to make it min width so it is mobile first.

Second problem that i encountred was that some of the features that i included on the website gets dissapered once i push it to the github pages. however it is completely fine on the original file. the example below show the problem:

### Original file with no problem
https://github.com/mohitgautam1/Final-website/blob/master/Design/Icons%20and%20background.png

### After pushing the files to github pages.
https://github.com/mohitgautam1/Final-website/blob/master/Design/github%20problem.png

As we can see that three line for menu dissapears, background and the icons below on the footers. 
The problem is on all of the three pages.

### Javascript problem
on the Resume page the javascript of timeline isnt very consistency and smooth; this is due me having to change the code from max width to min width which then eventually made me leave it as it is due to the time getting closer to the assisngement deadline.


## Google Maps api problem
My google maps api doesnt seem to work as there seems to be error, on the javascript.


### refrences used
I have used most of the labs material for my work.
I have also looked at many youtube tutorials which i will be providing the link for it.
